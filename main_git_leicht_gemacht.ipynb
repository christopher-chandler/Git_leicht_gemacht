    "    - **Beispiel:** `echo \"Hallo Welt\"` gibt \"Hallo Welt\" auf der Konsole aus.\n",
    "    - **Beispiel:** `echo \"$msg\" > test.txt` schreibt den Inhalt der Variable `$msg` in die Datei `test.txt`. Wenn die Datei bereits existiert, wird sie überschrieben.\n",

    "- `cd`\n",
    "    - **Beschreibung:** Ändert das aktuelle Verzeichnis.\n",

    "Git speichert die verschiedenen Versionen des Programms bzw. der Datei(en) ab (wie Schnappschuesse), im Gegensatz zu anderen System, die lediglich die differenzen zu der urspruenglichen Hauptdatei abgespeichert. Deswegen koennen die Aenderungen als eine start *Stapel von Schnapschuessen*\n",

    "Die meisten Aktionen in Git benoetigen nur lokale Dateien und Ressourcen, um ausgefuehrt zu werden – im Allgemeinen werden keine Informationen von einem anderen Computer in deinem Netzwerk benoetigt. Die allermeisten Operationen koennen nahezu ohne jede Verzoegerung ausgefuehrt werden, da die vollstaendige Historie eines Projekts bereits auf dem jeweiligen Rechner verfuegbar ist.\n",

    "### 1.3.3 Git stellt Integritaet sicher\n",
    "Von allen zu speichernden Daten berechnet Git Pruefsummen (engl. **checksum**) und speichert diese als Referenz zusammen mit den Daten ab. Das macht es unmoeglich, dass sich Inhalte von Dateien oder Verzeichnissen aendern, ohne dass Git das mitbekommt. Git basiert auf dieser Funktionalitaet und sie ist ein integraler Teil der Git-Philosophie. Man kann Informationen deshalb z.B. nicht waehrend der Uebermittlung verlieren oder unwissentlich beschaedigte Dateien verwenden, ohne dass Git in der Lage waere, dies festzustellen.\n",

    "### 1.3.4 Git fuegt im Regelfall nur Daten hinzu\n",

Deshalb ist es sehr schwer, das System dazu zu bewegen, irgendetwas zu tun, das nicht wieder rueckgaengig zu machen ist, oder dazu, Daten in irgendeiner Form zu loeschen. Unter anderem deshalb macht es so viel Spass mit Git zu arbeiten. Man weiss genau, man kann ein wenig experimentieren, ohne befuerchten zu muessen, irgendetwas zu zerstoeren oder durcheinander zu bringen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.5 Die drei Zustaende\n",
    "Es folgt die wichtigste Information, die man sich merken muss, wenn man Git erlernen und dabei Fallstricke vermeiden will. Git definiert drei Hauptzustaende, in denen sich eine Datei befinden kann: committet (engl. **committed**), geaendert (engl. **modified**) und fuer Commit vorgemerkt (engl. **staged**).\n",
